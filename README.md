# OpenAI Universe

Added my-world-of-bits environment with a one-shot character recognition experimental setup. 
The experiment uses the omniglot dataset published by Lake at. al (https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) and is guided from the setup for human participants in their paper "Human level concept learning through probabilistc program induction".

The environment is hosted in a docker container and can be connected to via VNC to let the agent make observations and get reward. The work is used in my BSc Project work.


Setup instructions: TODO
